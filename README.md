# Data Visualization: Students Performance with Tableau
A Public Dashboard for students performance analysis


## Senario

I searched for highly rated data set used on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and I found this Data Set is used frequently for analysis and visualization.


## [Students Performance in Exams Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams):

I downloaded the CSV file and take an overview about the data before starting the Analysis Process.

We have 
- 1 thausand Record of Student 
- 5 Groups of Students (A, B, C, D, E)
